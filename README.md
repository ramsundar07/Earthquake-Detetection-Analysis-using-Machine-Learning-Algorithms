# Earthquake-Detetection-Analysis-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms

## Introduction
  Earthquake early warning system is the technology used to alert the population center before earthquake arrives.
It helps to prevent from unwanted loss of precious life and avoid destructive damage.
  
  In the recent years, earthquakes occurred much more frequently and usually causes severe casualties Since earthquake had become a serious threat to human life and property, So a significant research effort has been devoted in developing Earthquake Early Warning (EEW) system.
But the Traditional criterion-based EEW method needs human surveillance to detect the threshold level of earthquake wave
Since it depends on human surveillance, Human needs to examine the complete waveform in order to detect the earthquake
This issue leads to automate EEW system.Here there are 4 Machine Learning Algorithms that has been used for analyis of earthquake detection.
